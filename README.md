# K-AGB
Stochastic simulation of aboveground biomass driven by land cover changes.

## Summary
Tropical Montane Forests (TMFs) are known for their freshwater resources, which feed rivers passing through major cities in the Andes. TMFs are highly biodiverse and essential for capturing carbon. However, measuring carbon pools in these topographically complex ecosystems is challenging. K-AGB implements a novel method for quantifying the carbon stored in the Aboveground Biomass (AGB) that combines several data sources, quantifies the predictive uncertainty, and uses land cover as the predictive variable.
